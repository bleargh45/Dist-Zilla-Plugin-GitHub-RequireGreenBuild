NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GitHub::RequireGreenBuild - Require a successful
    GitHub Actions workflow run

SYNOPSIS

      Configure Git with your GitHub login name:
    
        $ git config --global github.user YourLoginUsername
    
      then in your dist.ini:
    
        [GitHub::RequireGreenBuild]

DESCRIPTION

    This Dist::Zilla plugin checks your GitHub Actions for a successful
    run, before allowing a release.

    e.g. until we can determine that you have a green build for a GitHub
    Actions run against HEAD, you're not allowed to release.
