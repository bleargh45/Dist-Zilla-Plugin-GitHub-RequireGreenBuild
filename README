NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GitHub::RequireGreenBuild - Require a successful
    GitHub Actions workflow run

SYNOPSIS

      # in your dist.ini:
      [GitHub::RequireGreenBuild]

DESCRIPTION

    This Dist::Zilla plugin checks your GitHub Actions for a successful
    run, before allowing a release.

    e.g. until we can determine that you have a green build for a GitHub
    Actions run against HEAD, you're not allowed to release.

    To determine whether or not a successful run exists, we page through
    all of your GitHub Actions runs, to find a successful run for the
    current HEAD SHA.

    This comes with the implicit expectation that you have already pushed
    your commits back up to GitHub. If you haven't pushed, we find any runs
    matching the current HEAD, and you won't be able to release.
